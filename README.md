A repository for the Dora workshop I'm running on 26/11/2025

# Getting started
I'm assuming you have Python installed from the Python workshop, so the easiest way to install `dora` is to use `pip`.
This can be done in two parts. The two parts are installed with
`pip install dora-rs-cli`
and
`pip install dora-rs`.

We also need `cv2` and `numpy` but I think they should already be installed. If not, then it's just
`pip install opencv-python numpy`
